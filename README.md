Just a little helper tool to assist in unzipping lot of files... I needed to go through 238 zipped folders, so i had to prepare this tool, i might not get to use it again... lol

# GUIDE

- clone the repo
- install dependency `npm i` or `yarn add`
- move the parent folder containing the multiple .zip files you wish to unzip to the **unzip_from** folder
- run the script using `npm start` or `yarn start`
